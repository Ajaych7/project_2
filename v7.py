Voice cloning requires a significant amount of high-quality audio data from the target speaker (5+ hours recommended).

Training from scratch requires powerful GPUs and can take days.

Ethical considerations: Only clone voices with proper consent.

For commercial use, consider professional solutions like Resemble.AI or Descript.
